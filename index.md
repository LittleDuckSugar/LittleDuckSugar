## Me

My name is Antoine, I'm 23 (build 2000-07) !

I currently work at [Framatome](https://www.framatome.com/fr/) ☢️ as an operational pilot for running IT projects.
<br>
I spent a year working here and there, testing other things.
<br>
I was a teacher in IT when I passed my first IT diploma.
<br>
I also worked in many other company like [Owlint](https://owlint.fr/) as a back-end dev and [ANANKÉ](https://ananke.eu/en/ananke-cogeneration-heat-recovery/) as an apprentice.

I'm back to school with [ESGI](https://www.esgi.fr/campus-lyon.html) in a management courses.
<br>
I passed a diploma in IT at [Ynov](https://www.ynov-paris.com/) in 2022.
<br>
I passed a diploma in electrical engineering and industrial computer science in the [IUT de Belfort-Montbéliard](http://www.iut-bm.univ-fcomte.fr/) in 2020.


I'm in love with drama, electronics and IT. Before everything, I want to share what I know with others.
