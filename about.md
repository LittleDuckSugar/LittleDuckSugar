## Introduction
### Bio

My name is Antoine, I'm 21 (build 2000-07) !

I'm currently in my 3rd years in an [IT school](https://www.ynov-paris.com/).
I passed a diploma in electrical engineering and industrial computer science in the [IUT de Belfort-Montbéliard](http://www.iut-bm.univ-fcomte.fr/) in 2020.
I'm in love with drama, electronics and IT. Before everything, I want to share what I know with others.
